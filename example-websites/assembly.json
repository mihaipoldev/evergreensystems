You get consistent pipeline execution regardless of your team's bandwidth, with no hiring, training, or turnover risk.",

A qualified conversation is defined as a scheduled meeting with a decision-maker or influencer who has an active project need, appropriate budget authority, and technical fit for your capabilities—verified through pre-call qualification. If meetings are booked but prospects no-show repeatedly despite our confirmation process, those count toward our commitment. We track show-up rates and optimize outreach to improve attendance, but cannot control prospect behavior once booked. No long-term contract required—if the pilot delivers results, we transition to ongoing monthly engagement; if not, you walk away with the pipeline generated and owe nothing further.",
          "ongoing_terms": "After the 60-day pilot, we review results together in a structured debrief: meetings delivered, show-up rates, pipeline value, and feedback on conversation quality. If we've hit targets and you're seeing ROI potential, we transition to an ongoing month-to-month engagement at $6,000-8,000/month depending on volume (20-30 conversations/month at $6K, 30-40/month at $8K). No long-term contract lock-in—either party can cancel with 30 days notice. Ongoing engagement includes continuous optimization (refining targeting as we learn what converts, expanding to new verticals as capacity allows, A/B testing messaging). As your capacity grows and you want to scale beyond 40 meetings/month, we can structure tiered pricing or move to a hybrid model where we train an internal SDR using our systems and intelligence. The goal is sustainable pipeline growth that fills your production schedule to 75-85% utilization with recurring manufacturing partners, not dependency on us forever."
